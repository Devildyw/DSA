# Recurison & Divide and Conquer

## Recurison
*The basic idea of recursion is that a function calls itself directly or indirectly, so that the solution of the original problem is transformed into many sub-problems of the same nature but smaller scale.*

~~*To understand recurison, you have to understand what is the recursion first. f**k!*~~

## Divide
*The core idea of divide and conquer algorithm is "divide and conquer."*

*The general process can be divided into three steps: decomposition -> solution -> merge.*

*1. Decompose the original problem into sub-problem with the same structure.*

*2. After decomposing to an easy-to-solve boundary, recursive solution is performed.*

*3. Combine the solution of the sub-problem into the solution of the original problem.*

*The problems that divide and conquer can solve generally have the following characteristics:*

* *The scale of the problem can be easily solved by reducing it to a certain extent.*
* *The problem can be decomposed into several smaller-scale identical problems, that is, the problem has the property of optimal substructure, and the solutions of the subproblems decomposed by the problem can be combined into the solution of the problem.*
* *The sub-problems decomposed by the problem are independent of each other, that is, the sub-problems do not contain common sub-problems.*

---
The difference between recursion and enumeration is: enumeration divides the problem horizontally, and then solves the sub-problems in turn; while recursion divides the problem level by level, which is a vertical division.

Recursion is a programming technique, a way of thinking to solve problems; divide-and-conquer algorithm is largely based on recursive, algorithmic thinking to solve more specific problems.
