# Greedy Algorithm

*Greedy algorithm is the use of a computer to simulate the decision-making process of a "greedy" person. This person is very greedy and always selects the best operation according to a certain index for every move. Moreover, he is short-sighted, always only looking in front of him, without considering the impact that may be caused in the future.
It is conceivable that not all the time the greedy method can obtain the optimal solution, so in general, when using the greedy method, you must ensure that you can prove its correctness.*

*Scope of application
Greedy algorithms are particularly effective in problems with optimal substructures. The optimal sub-structure means that the problem can be resolved into sub-problems to be solved, and the optimal solution of the sub-problems can be deduced to the optimal solution of the final problem.*
